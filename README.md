# Environmental-Sustainability-of-Different-Public-Modes-of-Transport-in-Mumbai
Sustainable transport is the solution to the traffic problems of cities. Encouraging public transport over private transport can reduce various externalities associated with the increasing traffic like traffic congestion, air and noise pollution. Here the environmental sustainability of different transport modes were assessed based on the kg CO2 emissions. It was found out that suburban trains had the highest kg CO2 emission per day but had the lowest emission factor (kg CO2/pax-km). This can be attributed to the high passenger volume it carriers. The social cost of carbon emissions were also calculated and it was found out that Mumbai incurred approximately 585 crore INR due to CO2 emissions from public transport mode. Finally, few policies to improve and enhance the public transport modes and reduce the CO2 emissions were provided.
